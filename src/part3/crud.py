"""Create/read/update/delete operations over the in-memory product store.

Every operation takes the store -- a list of
:data:`~src.part3.storage.Product` tuples -- as its first argument and
works on it in place. The failure path never raises: the operation prints
an explanatory message to stdout and returns ``None``.

The identifier of a new product is derived from the store itself
(:func:`generate_product_id`): one past the greatest identifier in use, or
:data:`~src.part3.storage.PRODUCT_ID_MIN` when the store is empty.

Every product name that reaches the store is passed through
:func:`~src.part3.utils.normalize_product_name` first. A name that
normalises to an empty string is rejected -- the operation prints a
message and changes nothing. Names are also kept unique --
:func:`create_product` refuses a normalised name that is already taken,
and :func:`update_product` refuses one that is already taken by another
product.
